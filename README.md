I've been on teams using A* in the past and inheriently became interested in the algorithm. Most recently, I completed a course in "Data Structures and Algorithms" on CodeCademy where I learned a bit more about how it is typically implemented as a graph. Finally, with a dash of free time, I decided to try and write it from scratch to secure the knowledge. An interactive output can be seen below:

The code for the base Tkinter grid was pulled from [stack exchange](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30023763/how-to-make-an-interactive-2d-grid-in-a-window-in-python), but was heavily modified for this learning experience.
